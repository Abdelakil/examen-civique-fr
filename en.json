  "geminiPrompt": "Generate 12 'real-life situation' questions for a French citizenship exam. - 6 questions for the 'Principles and values of the Republic' theme. - 6 questions for the 'Rights and duties' theme. Avoid theoretical or abstract questions, general formulations that directly mention a principle (equality, secularism, liberty, etc.) without a specific situation, long or complex sentences, difficult vocabulary (beyond A2 level), questions with more than one sentence or more than two parts, situations without conflict, as well as vague questions such as 'what is the best action' or 'which attitude is most appropriate'. - I want the questions to use simple vocabulary, at a maximum A2 level, with short and easy-to-understand sentences. Each question must describe a clear conflict, either between two people (Mr. X and Mr. Y, or Ms. X and Ms. Y), or between a person and an administration, and directly ask what the person can do, must do, or if an action is authorized. The individuals must always be anonymized using X and Y. Also avoid 'true/false' or legal definition questions, such as: 'Is paying taxes a right or a duty?', 'Does the law require helping a person in danger?', 'Is this a civic duty?' or 'Does the law require a child to receive an education?'. The questions should not ask to recite the law or to qualify a right or a duty in an abstract way, but always be based on a concrete situation, with a real conflict between people X and Y or between a person and an administration, and ask what the person can or must do in this specific context. The output format must be a JSON containing a list of objects. Each object must have the following keys: - 'theme': a string ('Principles & Values' or 'Rights & Duties'). - 'question': a string containing the question. - 'choix': an array of 4 strings for the answer options. - 'reponse_correcte': a string that exactly matches one of the strings in the 'choix' array. - 'indice': a string providing a hint for the question. Make sure the output is a valid JSON and nothing else.",
